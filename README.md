To see it playing simply open index.html in your browser.

I've tried many modifications and it still doesn't seem to learn. I still want to try to increase the population size by making them playing in batches.

Right now I wont keep working in this example until I have learned more about Tensorflow, but the following steps are:

 - Refactor the code. 
 - Properly implement NEAT algorythm.
 - Add a small interface to save/load models and the option to see only one playing by itself


Currently I'm testing:
 - Divide the population in batches.
 - Increase the confidence limit needed to press a button
